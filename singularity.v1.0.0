%setup
  # Make a directory to store various files. We need bin to run, the others are
  # just to be informative for anyone who only has the container at hand.
  mkdir -p ${SINGULARITY_ROOTFS}/opt/cat12_spm

%files
  # Copy Matlab executable from bin (on host) to /cat12_spm in the container.
  # No processing happens without it!
  bin /opt/cat12_spm

  # Let's also copy the source code. It is not needed to run the container, but
  # it could be helpful for someone if we include it anyway.
  src /opt/cat12_spm

  # And the README file.
